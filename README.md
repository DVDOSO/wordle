# Wordle

Created to demonstrate Python capabilites to students in a Summer Camp.

It is a basic program and has some limitations:
- Does not check for guess validity
- Words chosen must be hard coded into the program

Must install the colorama module to run the program: [https://pypi.org/project/colorama/](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/).
